**Prompt:**

I have built a complete SME (Small & Medium Enterprise) management software called "BizEase UAE" with the following completed features:

## Current System:
- **Tech Stack:** Node.js + Express backend, React frontend, SQL Server database, Firebase authentication
- **Completed Modules:**
  1. Employee Management (HR) - Full CRUD, document management, expiry tracking
  2. Invoice Management - Create invoices, PDF generation, multi-currency, multi-language
  3. VAT Module (UAE compliant) - VAT calculation, reports, CSV/PDF exports, filing reminders
  4. Inventory Management - Stock tracking, sales recording
  5. Expense Management - Expense tracking, categorization, receipt upload
  6. Notifications System - Real-time notifications, automatic expiry alerts, email digests
  7. Dashboard - Key metrics, charts, quick actions
  8. Reports - Sales, VAT, expense reports with exports
  9. Multi-language support (English/Arabic with RTL)
  10. Role-based access control (Admin, Staff, Accountant)

## Current Capabilities:
- Employee management with document expiry tracking
- Invoice creation with VAT calculation (5% UAE standard rate)
- VAT reporting and FTA-ready exports
- Inventory and sales tracking
- Expense management
- Automatic notifications for expiries
- Dashboard with business metrics
- Multi-language support

## What's Missing:
- No accounting module (general ledger, chart of accounts, financial statements)
- No payroll module
- No CRM features (sales pipeline, lead management)
- No project management
- Limited reporting (no custom report builder)
- No payment gateway integration
- No bank integration
- No mobile app
- No advanced analytics

## My Question:
What should be the next development priorities to make this a complete, production-ready SME management software? Please provide:

1. **Recommended priority order** for implementing missing features
2. **Technical recommendations** for each priority (best practices, libraries, architecture)
3. **Estimated complexity** (Low/Medium/High) for each feature
4. **Dependencies** between features (what should be built first)
5. **Quick wins** - features that can be implemented quickly with high business value
6. **Long-term roadmap** - 12-month development plan

Please consider:
- This is for UAE market (VAT compliance already done)
- Target users: Small to medium businesses
- Current tech stack should be maintained where possible
- Need production-ready, scalable solutions
